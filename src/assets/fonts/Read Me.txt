We use the 'Material Icons' set from Google.

To avoid importing all the icons we have a custom subset created using the app IcoMoon.

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.

From then export just a subset with the additional icons added.
